# Stock Prediction Model

A machine learning model for stock price prediction using historical market data.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a stock prediction system that analyzes historical stock data to forecast future price movements. The model is built using machine learning techniques to identify patterns and trends in financial markets.

## 🚀 Features

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Processes historical stock data to identify patterns
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms for price prediction
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: Easy-to-follow notebook format for experimentation
- **Colab-Compatible**: Created and optimized for Google Colaboratory

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: (Specific libraries would be detailed in the notebook)
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, etc.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

└── (Additional data files would typically be included)
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aswanihritik/stock-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd stock-prediction
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**:
   - Using Jupyter: `jupyter notebook IBCS_EE.ipynb`
   - Or open directly in Google Colab

## 📊 Usage

1. Open `IBCS_EE.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Follow the notebook instructions to load stock data
3. Execute the cells sequentially to load dependencies
4. Run the model training and prediction cells
5. Analyze the results and predictions

## 📈 Model Details

*Note: The specific model architecture, features, and algorithms would be detailed in the Jupyter notebook. Common approaches for stock prediction include:*

- Time series analysis
- Regression models
- LSTM neural networks for sequential data
- Feature engineering from historical prices and volumes
